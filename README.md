    object:

    Its the 1930's during the prohibition. Escape with your sun from the mob. use all alchohol
    around to your advantage(which at the time is not functioning)

    controls:

    z = jump
    x = shoot
    s = hide (also have your son take cover)
    directional pad = movement

    how to play ROM..

    open the included visual Boy advance. then open ROM.

    just a note, this game only has one bad guy at the moment, so if you want to play around
    more with the enemy just reset the ROM.
